  title: ETM API (ESS->DSS and ESS->ESS)
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >-
    Interface definitions for communication between an ETM Service Supplier (ESS)
    and a DSS, as well as for communication between two ESSs.

    DSS functionality includes identification of peer ETM ESS instances
    (managing flight operational intents and constraints). ESS functionality
    includes sharing details of flight operational intents and constraints.

    Note: Unless otherwise specified, fields specified in a message but not
    declared in the API must be ignored.

    Whenever a object-type field may be omitted, it may also be set to null for
    the same effect.

      description: >-
        Authorization from, or on behalf of, an authorization authority.  This
        authority will issue access tokens that are JSON Web Tokens as defined
        in RFC 7519, using the `RS256` algorithm for the signature, publish to
        all providers the public key for verifying that signature, and implement
        standard OAuth server discovery mechanisms as described in RFC 8414.

        The following fields must be included in the JWT claim for access tokens
        issued by this authority:

        * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was
        received.

        * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.

        * `sub`, with unique ID of the client requesting the access token.

        * `scope`, with a string composed of a space-separated list of strings
        indicating the scopes granted, per RFC 6749.

        * `jti`, according to RFC 7519.

        Following the principle of least privilege, only one of the scopes
        enumerated in this document should be granted in a single token (though
        other scopes may accompany it).  The tokens granted by this authority
        must protect against reuse of received tokens to impersonate the sender
        to other recipients (via use of the `aud` claim or other means).

        When using the `aud` claim to protect against the reuse of received
        tokens, and absent guidance on behalf of the competent authority to the
        contrary, the JWT `aud` claim requested by the client must be included
        in each access token and must contain the fully qualified domain name of
        the URL the access token will be used to access.  For example, if an ESS
        were querying the endpoint at
        https://dss.example.com:8888/rid/v2/dss/identification_service_areas,
        the access token included in the request should specify `"aud":
        "dss.example.com"`.

        Clients must provide these access tokens in an `Authorization` header in
        the form `Bearer <token>` in accordance with RFC 6750.

        current Key constructed from information obtained with previous read
        operations and subsequent requests for full information, and optionally,
        subscription updates for deconflicted write operations to the DSS.  The
        contents of this data structure are generated by the client.

        include a Key containing all OVNs for all relevant Entities.

        The create or update request for this operational intent reference must

        details.

        In this state, the `/ess/v1/operational_intents/{entityid}/telemetry`
        ESS-ESS endpoint should respond, if available, to queries from ESS
        peers.  The create or update request for this operational intent may
        omit a Key in this case because the operational intent is being adjusted
        as flown and cannot necessarily deconflict.

        'Contingent': UA is considered unrecoverably unable to conform with its
        coordinate operational intent; see standard text for more details.

        This state must transition to Ended.  In this state, the

        forbidden in a zone that has conditional access.

        By difference with the “Message” field per zone, this coded expression
        is made to be interopreted by the UAS while the “Message” is to
        interpreted by the remote pilot.

        NOTE: the maximum field length is 10 000 characters.

        ---------------------- Condition definition language ---------------- •
        A list of relevant characteristics (CHARTYPE) has first to be
        established per state, and their finite list of acceptable values
        (CHARVAL)

        • Each chartype and charval fields are defined by a limited set of
        characters

        • A public document shall give the definitions of each, and provide the
        reference to legal or technical characteristics implied

        • The Geozone editor per state can use these characteristics, with the
        dedicated condition language defined below, to define exact conditions
        per zone

        • Each UAS Geofencing function shall be loaded with the corresponding
        chararacteristic status of the UAS for the intended flight, so as to be
        able to apply the conditions , either to generate alerts or to limit the
        flight

        • If the value of a given characteristic of the condition equation is
        not defined in the UAS, the UAS Geofencing function should inform the
        pilot in Geoawareness alerting or consider that the zone is forbidden,
        by default in automatic Geofencing.

        A conditional expression shall be of the following type:

        • The UAS is PERMITTED XOR PROHIBITED (exclusive choice) to fly in this
        zone at this time IF (Characteristic1) CHARTYPE1 = (Value1) CHARVAL1 AND

        CHARTYPE 2 = CHARVAL 2 AND ... AND End IF

        OR (...)

        ...

        End OR

        • Only the fields in bold need to be edited in the character string,
        separated by”/”. Others are implicit.

        Examples of CHARTYPE and CHARVALUE:

        • CHARTYPE: operator type; Acceptable CHARVAL values:
        Military/Police/Firefighting

        • CHARTYPE: Operator ID (registration number); Acceptable CHARVAL
        values: as per registration format

        • CHARTYPE: Operation type: A1 as per EASA Open Types or S1 (National
        standard Scenario 1), STS01 (EASA Specific standard scenario) or ...

        • CHARTYPE: ETM operation type: Planned/Unplanned,

        • CHARTYPE: passengers on board: yes /no Note that it is possible in
        each national catalog of chartype and charval items, to define complex
        categories of operation/drone /equipment. Example: In nation A, we may
        have a type “drone level” with values Low, Medium, High. Each level
        corresponds to a defined set of required UAS performance/operation
        features/ operator qualification etc. This avoids to code a complex
        combination in the geozone database. This conditional expression can
        also be used to code a prohibition of image capture in a zone.

        Example: PERMITTED/IMAGE CAPTURE=NO/NOISE

          CLASS=A/OR/OPERATOR=POLICE

        Meaning: >-
           the fight is permitted in this zone at that time if No image is
        captured (removed or deactivated) and if noise class = class A
        (following a known classification) or if the UAS operator is the Police

        despite using the HTTP POST verb.  The HTTP GET verb is traditionally
        used for operations like this one, but requiring or using a request body
        for HTTP GET requests is non-standard and not supported by some
