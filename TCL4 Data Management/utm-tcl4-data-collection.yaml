          loitering, landing occurs during operation, USS must prompt operator to
          file at least one report when the operation closes.

          Reason must be one of the following Enum values:
          [NONCONFORMING, ROGUE, NONCONFORMING2ROGUE, UNPLANNED_RTL, UNPLANNED_LOITER, UNPLANNED_LANDING, VOLUNTEER].
          NONCONFORMING means the operation closed after entering nonconforming state. When multiple nonconformances occur use the first one as the reason.
          ROGUE means the operation closed after entering rogue state.
          NONCONFORMING2ROGUE means the operation entered nonconforming state then rogue state then closed.
          UNPLANNED_RTL means UA made unplanned return to the launch location (e.g., due to unexpected low battery status).
          UNPLANNED_LOITER means UA performed unplanned loitering or hovering (e.g., to regain C2 link).
          UNPLANNED_LANDING means UA made unplanned landing (e.g., due to unexpected low battery status).
          VOLUNTEER means this report is filed in addition to USS prompted mandatory one, OR filed without USS prompt (e.g., reporter requests the form to be made available).
